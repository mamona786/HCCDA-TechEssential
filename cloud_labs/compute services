Cloud compute services (like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines)?

A software service that performs computations (e.g., a microservice or backend server)?

A business offering compute power (e.g., HPC services or GPU rental platforms)?

Something else?


Let me know the context, and I can give you a focused answer.
